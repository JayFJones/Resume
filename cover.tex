\noindent 
I am writing today in regards to the position...

\noindent I have worked on the same project for 10 years and find
that I am looking for a new challenge and a chance to grow my 
skill-set and career.   <Continue with information specific to the 
position being considered.>


In my current position with Arris I design and develop software
that runs on a world class Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS).  This
system is responsible for providing reliable phone, television, and Internet
service to many customers of Comcast, Time-Warner, and other 
cable companies. During my time with Arris I have developed software
for the CMTS using the C and C++ languages and have provided tools and test 
suites for our C/C++ code using Java and Perl.

I love learning the nuances of computer languages and enjoy 
when I am able to design and make tools.  It is an even greater
feeling of accomplishment when I can then refine a tool so that it is a
pleasure to be used by colleagues and customers alike.

In the fifteen years that I have worked for Arris/Nortel I have weathered 
the dot-com bust and the recession.  Over this time I have been relocated twice 
to provide expertise and training to new groups within the organization. 
 
\noindent I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss <position/opportunity>
with you at a date, time, and place of your
convenience. I can be contacted by phone (678-765-9529) or e-mail (jay.f.jones@gmail.com).

\noident Thank you for your consideration.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
